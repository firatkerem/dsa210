# The Impact of Screen Time on Financial Decisions - DSA210 Term Project

## Overview

In this project, I will analyze how my screen time and app usage influence my spending behavior. With the increasing role of digital platforms in everyday life, I have become more aware of how my phone usage might be shaping my financial habits. I often spend a significant amount of time on various apps, and I suspect that this engagement—especially with e-commerce and food delivery platforms—may contribute to increased spending.

Through data tracking and analysis, I will explore trends in my app interactions, comparing them with my transaction history to identify potential spending triggers. By examining patterns in my daily phone activity, I aim to uncover whether higher screen time or specific app categories influence my purchasing decisions. Ultimately, this study will help me gain deeper insights into my financial habits and assess whether modifying my digital behavior could lead to more mindful spending choices.

### **Hypotheses**
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):**
  There is no statistically significant relationship between screen time or app usage duration and spending behavior.


- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):**
  Increased screen time or frequent use of certain applications (e.g., e-commerce and food delivery apps) leads to higher spending habits.

## Research Objectives  

1. **Identify Patterns**  
   - Determine whether there is a significant correlation between daily screen time and spending patterns.

2. **App-Specific Impact**  
   - Understand which categories of apps (e-commerce, food delivery, social media) have the strongest influence on spending behavior.

3. **Behavioral Triggers**  
   - Pinpoint the moments or triggers—such as weekend browsing—that may lead to impulsive or higher spending.

4. **Practical Recommendations**  
   - Propose actionable steps to improve financial habits if a substantial link between screen time and spending is confirmed.

## Methodology  

### **1. Raw Data Collection**  

- **Screen Time Data**  
  - Tracked using built-in phone settings or a digital well-being app.  
  - Exported to an Excel file and categorized by individual apps (e.g., shopping, social media, entertainment).  
  - Converted into a CSV format for analysis.  

- **Transaction Records**  
  - Official bank statements will be used to track categorized expenses.
  - Transactions will be classified into categories such as food, shopping, entertainment, and subscriptions.  
  - Data will be transferred to an Excel file and later converted into CSV format for analysis.  

- **Day of the Week**  
  - Recorded to analyze differences in spending behavior between weekdays and weekends.  

- **Data Collection Period**  
  - The data collection will span several weeks or months to capture both regular spending patterns and anomalies.

### **2. Data Cleaning and Integration**  

- **Standardization**  
  - Timestamps and formats will be unified for seamless data merging.  

- **Error Handling**  
  - Duplicate entries and missing values will be identified and appropriately handled.
    
- **Categorization**  
  - Expenses and app usage will be grouped into relevant categories for structured analysis.  

- **Data Merging**  
  - Processed screen time and spending data will be combined based on date to create a unified dataset.  

---

### **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  

- **Descriptive Statistics**  
  - Identify trends in screen time and spending.  

- **Visualizations**  
  - **Histograms** for spending distribution.  
  - **Scatter plots to examine the relationship between screen time and spending patterns.
  - **Line charts will be used to analyze weekly and monthly spending trends.

---

### **4. Analysis and Modeling**  

- **Correlation Analysis**  
  - Measure relationships between screen time and spending habits.  

- **Regression Models**  
  - **Linear Regression** to assess predictive power.  
  - **Decision Trees** if non-linear trends emerge.  

---

### **5. Storage and Version Control**  

- **Final Dataset**  
  - Cleaned CSV files will be stored systematically for analysis.  

- **Analysis Scripts**  
  - Python scripts will be used for data processing, visualization, and modeling.

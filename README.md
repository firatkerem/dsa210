# Understanding My Spending Behavior - DSA210 Term Project

## Overview
In this project, I will analyze how my screen time and app usage influence my spending behavior. By examining patterns in my daily phone activity, I aim to uncover whether increased screen time or specific apps contribute to higher spending habits. My goal is to identify correlations between digital engagement and financial decisions, ultimately gaining insights into how my usage patterns shape my purchasing behavior.

Through data tracking and analysis, I will explore trends in my app interactions, comparing them with my transaction history to determine potential spending triggers. This study will help me better understand my financial habits and possibly develop strategies to make more conscious spending decisions.
